# Project libft

## Overview
Libft is the first project once you enroll at School 42, serving as a cornerstone for learning the C programming language. It focuses on recreating various standard C library functions, empowering students to delve into the intricacies of these functions by implementing them from scratch. This version improves the libft to add useful tools such as get_next_line, a custom implementation of printf and a binary search tree.

## Importance of Authentic Learning
📚 **Authentic Learning:** 📚
At its core, School 42 encourages a culture of authentic learning. The emphasis lies not only in flawless execution but in understanding concepts, problem-solving, and honing coding skills. Copying or cheating dilutes the essence of this learning experience, hindering personal growth and skill development. **For 42 students who might read this, I strongly advocate for discussing concepts with peers instead of directly referring to this code.** If you came here for advices, my advice would be: learn to test your code, go read about test driven development.

## What is School 42?
🏫 **About School 42:** 🏫
School 42 is a unique coding school that operates under a peer-to-peer learning system. It fosters an environment where students learn by doing, collaborating, and problem-solving. At School 42, projects like libft are designed to impart practical knowledge and skill-building rather than focusing solely on theoretical aspects.

## Coding Foundations: The libft Experience?
🧠 **What future-me thinks he learned coding libft:** 🧠
During the libft project, I focused on mastering pointers, using and understanding addresses, and memory comprehension and manipulation at a byte level. At first understanding linked lists and coding functions without real-world applications proved challenging. However I dealt with that in following projects and using my freshly-coded libft made sense. Do note that a significant part of this project was invested in crafting test functions, though they are not included here.
